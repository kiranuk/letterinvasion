	LETTER INVADERS

This game is inspired by space invaders or you mostly sees the word games.
Here I use this name due to letters fall from top to bottom, which invades the bottom floor with letters.
User job is to kill before it reaches to bottom screen.
Now the question is how to kill these invaders, simple just type the letter which is shown in screen.
It'simple right, but be careful invaders gets increment their speed in certain time limit.
User has 10 chances only, if user misses 10 letters and they reaches the floor then the game will break, it means user lose the game.
By playing this game will increase user's knowledge with position of keys and also improves user's typing speed.
Hope i give enough details,Now just keep calm and kill all invaders. BEST OF LUCK
